Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)

My work for learning to perform feed forward neural networks.


MNIST     |     TRAINING ACCURACY: 98%     |     VALIDATION ACCURACY 97%

3 fully connected layers with 100 hidden features each.
Stochastic gradient descent optimization.


CIFAR10     |     TRAINING ACCURACY: 92%      |     VALIDATION ACCURACY: 85% 

1 fully connected layer with 500 hidden features.
Stochastic gradient descent optimization.
