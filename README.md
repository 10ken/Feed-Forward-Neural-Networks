Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)

My work for learning to perform feed forward neural networks.

Currently I have performed an FNN on MNIST and CIFAR10

MNIST     |     RAINING ACCURACY: 98%     |     VALIDATION ACCURACY 97%



CIFAR10     |     TRAINING ACCURACY: 92%      |     VALIDATION ACCURACY: 85%
